            "section5": "Software Development is an intellectually and emotionally demanding discipline. The most reliable way to create the motivation to withstand these difficulties, and continually expand one's knowledge, is by working on exciting, personal creative projects. No level of discipline trumps the energy that's generated when one becomes excited about a creative idea. We encourage students to take on such challenges, even if they seem slightly outside their current reach, and help them along the way to complete the projects they start.",

We’ll start off with a practical introduction to the Human Centered Design process. We’ll go through one iteration of the design steps —starting from research all the way to prototyping and testing. We'll continue with analyzing and carefully re-constructing multiple websites built for different use-cases. We’ll dive into design systems, color theory, and typography. At the end of the module, everyone will design and build a personal website project that may become the first item in their portfolio. The projects will be documented via building out their Information Architecture.",

            "sectionHeader7": "Backend Engineering",
            "section7": "To round off the skillset, we'll build and deploy the backend of our web application. This is the most challenging part of the course, as it normally requires a long time to master the complexities of a production level backend, including authentication, database design & continuous deployment. However, with a lot of focus, carefully designed instruction, and a bit of cheating you'll become able to build a full stack web application from start to finish all by yourself.",
