      <p>
        We believe software development is one of the most fulfilling and
        empowering creative disciplines in today's world. At the same time,
        mastering its many facets is a demanding, life-long challenge. A
        challenge, we believe, that's best tackled with the support of a strong
        community, where members learn from each other and join forces on their
        personal and professional journeys. What started as a code camp to teach
        beginners how to program and find a career in software development, is
        quickly growing into such a community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it's in classes and workshops in the Academy, in personal or
        professional projects in the Studio, or by participating in our events;
        the members of the Devhaus Leipzig strive to create a vibrant
        environment in which everyone finds support to grow their technical and
        creative abilities.
